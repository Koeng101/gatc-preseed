A friend made this repo. I really like the overall design style, but I want to adapt it to something completely different.

I am founding a company called Genetic Assemblies. I included my memo as a text file in seed.txt. My goal is to adapt this template to contain the content. There will be a couple parts:

1. The pitch deck. This is the first page, and should kind of be like a slide deck / pitch. It'll be relatively short, and tell the story of the company
2. The memo. Basically just the text of the memo with some visualizations on the side.
3. The essays, each an individual tab. These include the appendix essays.

# pitch deck

This should have a couple "pages" or slides or whatever. The below is an outline of the context, but doesn't have to be exact. It is written to quickly educate someone on what we are doing - the kind of thing a VC would skim over a minute or two.

### pg1

AI is accelerating biology. But we are limited by the number of experiments we can run

### pg2

#### The problem

We need to run more biology experiments to validate new drugs or biological designs. However:
- Experiments take a ton of skilled manual labor
- Labs cost a lot of capex

### pg3

#### Our solution

We build and run labs that remotely execute experiments and give back real data

### pg4

(this should be like a 1-2-3 kind of thing)

#### How it works

1. *Write code.* Humans or agents write code to do a biological experiment
2. *Our robots execute the code.* Robots autonomously execute experiments without human input.
3. *We give you the ouputs.* Samples or data

### pg5

#### Team (pull basics from memo)

### pg6

leave blank, wait for us to iterate together on this.



# memo

the memo is stored in seed.txt. Pull the information from there and make a nicely formatted page with it's data. This is optimized for someone to just read it. It should have the entire memo other than the appendix sections, which contain essays.

# essays

For now, just have the two essays



# Website construction

Try to separate out the raw writing and the formatting and styling so that we can quickly iterate. Leave a lot of the visualizations blank with a placeholder for now.
