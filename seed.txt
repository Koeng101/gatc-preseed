Genetic Assemblies

0. Summary

Using the latest software tools and AI models, you've just designed an awesome
new biological drug to treat Alzheimer's (or any other industrial/consumer
biotech application, perhaps a longevity drug, or a new food ingredient). Now
you have to actually test it in real life, because the algorithms sometimes mess
up. How do you test your brand new idea?

Right now, this involves working with an opaque chain of companies to produce
material to test, and then you have to run it in your own lab. If you don't
specialize in robotics (and as biologists, you shouldn't), you have to both
equip this lab, costing ~$50k-$500k, and then you have to run it yourself, which
usually takes an incredible amount of manual labor - nearly always requiring
several new hires just to operate the lab.

Alternatively, you could hire a contract research organization (CROs), which
can do your experiments for you. Yet still - they run the experiments with
fallible humans in a lab, and your communication is with other humans to plan
and do the experiments. You have to pay for all that communication and
specialized labor. And yet, even with these inefficiencies, the market for CROs
is approximately $85B and expected to reach $125B by 2030 [4].

What if, instead, we replaced all those manual-labor laboratories and humans
writing emails with robots and software? Genetic Assemblies is solving the
problem of building and operating labs by building a system that allows you to
go from biological idea to biological data without ever stepping into a lab or
talking to a human. You define the experiment, and with the help of an AI coding
system it is translated to robot-friendly language and it is executed in our
automated lab.

The future is inevitably headed in this direction: AI systems from companies
like OpenAI are able to make theories and plan experiments [1] but unable to
run the actual experiments without outsourcing to humans in a lab [2]. We want
to enable these systems - and more importantly the humans controlling them - to
get actual biological results without resorting to purchasing in-house equipment
and manually running experiments.

Describe your experiment. Run it with us. Get back real data to inform your next
round of experiments or train your model.



1. Team

Genetic Assemblies is solo-founded by Keoni Gandall. Keoni worked at UCI for 4
years in Chang Liu's lab in directed evolution and mitochondrial engineering,
and then worked for 3 years in Drew Endy's lab at Stanford, running the
FreeGenes Project. Afterwards, he cofounded Trilobio, a company manufacturing
fully-automated lab robots. However, simply making hardware was not his calling,
so he founded Genetic Assemblies, with the goal of full automation as a service.
At Trilobio, Keoni was in charge of building the software systems for fully
automated labs.

Ben Ray has joined as our first founding engineer. Ben led the automation team
at Retro Biosciences, a large and successful longevity startup, for 3.5 years
before leaving and joining Genetic Assemblies. At Retro, Ben was in charge of
building and maintaining the hardware for fully automated robotic systems using
used robots and clever engineering.

We do not plan on hiring until we really need to. This will likely be either a
software engineer or a lab technician; whichever we really need help with.
Regardless, we encompass the software, hardware, and wetware skills necessary to
build the first iteration of Genetic Assemblies.

						   Genetic Assemblies Vision


0. First step

While we want to automate experiments end-to-end, a segmented chunk of the
vision has a clear and profitable value prop that we are executing on today
which builds towards our ultimate goal.

Right now, we are building synthetic DNA for customers. DNA encodes biological
information that can be converted into biological actions, and so is the perfect
place to start for our end-to-end biological foundry because it is, very often,
the beginning of an experiment.

Genetic Assemblies's core competency is logistics - including operation of
machines, production or acquisition of necessary materials, or running
experiments to streamline protocols - all backed by software, instead of humans.
This is a stark contrast to current competitors who primarily compete with a
specific technology, like enzymatic DNA synthesis or a few narrow optimized
protocols. This informs how we enter and compete in markets.

In synthetic DNA assembly, we have a very simple pipeline: we take DNA made from
oligo pool providers and we assemble it with known protocols [5]. While
conceptually simple, the devil is in the details:

  1. How do you design the oligo pool for customer assemblies?
  2. How much enzyme should you use? Which enzyme should you use?
  3. How does DNA transformation work on a robotic deck?
  4. How do you plate the cells without round petri dishes?
  5. How do we validate the outputs?
  6. How do you know which to repeat?

Rather than scope a new technology, we rigorously optimize each basic step in a
way that we can reuse for other experiments. For example, the plating protocol
we developed (6.5uL in a p20m tip 10mm above a plate, dispense 5uL slowly to
create a droplet on the tip, then stab the agar to create an evenly sized drop
on the surface that doesn't mix with other droplets on an SBS format plate. Dry
plate for approximately 15 minutes) we can use for things like colony counting,
transformation, or directed evolution. We build a library of these basic
protocols that can be recombined in new experiments.

For synthetic DNA assembly, we focused on the small things that nobody else
really cares about, like competent cell usage, specialized plasmid barcoding,
and operational simplicity for moving plates around. These add up to significant
savings: we predict we can synthesize 1kbp of clonal DNA at scale for
approximately 1/6 to 1/3 ($10-$20) of the incumbent's (Twist Bioscience) current
cost-of-goods ($60), which has not significantly changed in approximately 10yr.



1. Current Progress

We have 3 current customers. We choose these customers because their
workflows are generally useful to lots of other people, and can be used as
material input for future protocols.

We have additional demand for each category that we are currently unable to
serve with our current level of automation.

  Customer A: Cloned Plasmids - animal testing
    I. What are we doing?
	  - we build and validate synthetic DNA that is used to test DNA-based drugs
	    in animals
	II. How valuable is it?
	  - we charged approximately $100 per construct and have delivered 150
		constructs: (Total revenue: $15,000)
    III. What is the market size?
	  - ~$2B, based on Twist's IPO documents for DNA maker's market [3]

  Customer B: Cloned Plasmids - AI protein testing
    I. What are we doing?
	  - we build and validate synthetic DNA that is used to express AI-designed
	    proteins
	II. How valuable is it?
	  - we charged approximately $60 per construct and delivered 192 constructs:
		(Total revenue: $12,000)
    III. What is the market size?
	  - ~$2B

  Customer C: Linear DNA - AI protein testing
    I. What are we doing?
	  - we provide synthetic DNA that is used to express AI-designed proteins
	II. How valuable is it?
	  - we charged approximately $10 per construct and delivered 1000
		constructs: (Total revenue: $10,000). These are significantly simpler
		than Customer A and B's constructs, hence the price difference
    III. What is the market size?
	  - Much smaller (we speculate $10M to low $100M, little data), but this
	    protocol is useful as a material input to more valuable processes.

What we learned:
  1. Customers value the ability to recursively clone much more than we expected,
	 to the point where it is the primary value draw. (what this means is they
	 want the material they create to be used as input material for another
	 reaction or process)
  2. AI protein companies are more price-sensitive but timeline-and-failure
	 accepting than traditional biotech customers because they just need to train
	 models. Great for a small biotech company like us
  3. Figuring out sequencing is absolutely essential. This is our primary
	 operational material cost (before switching providers was >80% of the spend
	 for constructs)
Unit economics:
  - All services are independently profitable from a material cost perspective:
    customer A: during order, brought per construct cost from ~$90 to ~$30,
	  while selling for $100
	customer C: per construct cost of approximately $5, while selling for $10
  - Labor isn't profitable. Right now, to create around 10k of revenue, 2 to 4
    weeks of human labor is required. Once we have automated systems we get a
	~5x-10x decrease in labor costs, with only a ~20% increase in cost due to
	automation-compatible plastics.



2. The Dirty work ahead

Our most difficult challenges have been technical. The protocols which we run
for customers are very labor intensive. While this labor is automatable, we've
only been running a partially automated system while we figure out exactly what
to build by working with customers. Without full integration of the robotic and
software systems we can only serve limited customers, but also learn exactly
what we need to build.

So far, sales have not been a problem. There is demand for our services, but we
have not been able to serve it due to the labor-intensive nature without our
robotic systems in place. For example, we have a prospective customer that wants
to buy ~200 genes from us, but we haven't had the time to process the order. We
foresee this to be largely the case in the future, as our edge is ultra-low-cost
robotic labor, and we only move into markets where we know there is demand and
that we can hedge our unique advantage.

Our hypothesis is that, like with deploying software, there will be a massive
transition away from in-house labs to remote cloud labs. Right now, the market
is approximately $50B to $80B for more bespoke CRO services. If we see a
transition away from companies managing both the lab and the software/services
on top of those labs and towards companies only managing software/services in
our lab, we can create and capture billions in value. 



3. Our raise

We are raising $1.5M to fund capex and operations for 18 months. We hope to hit
the following milestones:
  A. Public launch of DNA assembly services (delivering ~96 plasmids per week)
  B. Grow from 3 to 20 customers
  C. One fully functioning automated workstation which can:
     - pipette
	 - thermocycle
	 - incubate (static and shaking)
	 - plate read
	 - centrifuge
	 - 4c storage

						   Genetic Assemblies Theory

				 Monopolization of Centralized Experimentation

Technological monopolies share some combination of the following characteristics:
  1. Network Effects
  2. Economies of Scale
  3. Proprietary Technology
  4. Branding

We believe that running biological laboratories is particularly prone to
monopolization for several reasons. We lay out our argument for this, and
conclude with how this impacts the direction of our company.

1. Biology has product and customer network effects

Product network effects are when a particular product becomes more valuable as a
function of how many people use it, with social networks being a perfect
example. Customer network effects are when the value of a product can increase the
more customers use it, with search engines being a perfect example.

Biological experimentation has both, so long as the protocols being run are
open. Science is based on replicating published papers: through people simply
replicating and tweaking experiments, we can know what operations need
optimization (customer network effects). But more importantly, so long as
people publish with experiments run in our lab, the lab itself becomes more
valuable. Any scientist who wants to expand on previous research will read
publications in their field. If everyone is running their experiments with
Genetic Assemblies, this makes them feel secure in running it with us. In fact,
if they didn't run their experiment with our labs, it would be less
scientifically rigorous: they are changing a variable (whose lab) that everyone
else has agreed on, and therefore they have to personally investigate the
downstream effects of that. Better to just stay safe and run it with us, where
it is easier and cheaper.

All other cloud labs ignore this dynamic. All have targeted pharma companies and
larger industrial clients who *do not publish* their experimental protocols. For
this reason, we plan to begin with smaller companies and academics who will
share, in niche markets, before expanding.

2. Biology has economies of scale

Our most common reaction called "GoldenGate Assembly" (for assembling DNA) costs
about $1 in enzymes from New England Biolabs. If you produce it yourself, for
about $100 to $200 you can produce 10,000,000 reactions worth. Academic labs
actually sometimes do do this, but normally companies do not because it takes
effort and troubleshooting, which if they just need 1 great enzyme doesn't help
the bottom line.

Companies that can take advantage of economies of scale make massive amounts of
profit, like Illumina or NEB. Often, however, the problem is distribution of
those advancements.

Biology is rife with examples of economies of scale - from transformation
efficiency, to enzyme production, to sequencing, but often they're too disparate
and innovating doesn't impact much profit usually. Distribution of innovations,
like new cloning strains, is too difficult and people don't want to put the
effort into changing. Genetic Assemblies has the unique advantage of
centralization and trust, meaning we can immediately distribute innovations. All
the protocols are running in our own lab anyway, and are controlled by software,
not by trained humans. Our focus is on the pedagogy of the machine rather than
the lab technician, which scales much better. This distribution allows us to
effectively create and capture the value of any economy of scale we discover.

3. Proprietary Technology

We're not a biology company; our users are. Much like TSMC doesn't design chips,
we do not compete with our customers. Labs like Ginkgo, and to some degree
Twist, can and do compete with their own customers with proprietary technology.
This is short term thinking.

Our proprietary technology is in the ways we put together and run experiments,
and in the logistics of our operations. Weakening of proprietary biotechnology,
through open source enzymes or open source strains, is effectively
commoditizing our complement, and driving more demand towards our services.

4. Branding

We want Genetic Assemblies to be known for biological innovation and doing
awesome biology experiments. Genuine and authentic joy for synthetic biology is
core to who we are! Sometimes, we run fun experiments to just do things - maybe
a genetically engineered logo, or unique Genetic Assemblies-only GMO foods for
events. I founded this company because I believe in open source biotechnology
for all, and the route of a centralized corporation running experiments is the
only structure I could think of that aligns my motivations with a ruthless
profit-motive, and hence, growth of my goals (tracked by revenue).

We care about awesome biological innovation and making experimentation cheaper
for everyone. We don't want just anti-vaxxers, we want rogue-vaxxers, making
their own vaccines! We want high schoolers and family farmers and patients to be
able to make their own awesome biological creations. This fundamental power, the
power of what we are, belongs not to just a handful of corporations, but to all.
We care about the ones who can't afford to build their own lab, we want to free
the ones chained to a bench doing experiments by hand. If you are to die from a
disease, who is to say you should not fight against the dying of the light with
the power of your own mind and the graceful actuation of our machines? Let's build
biotechnology that is more imaginative, more accessible, and more free; let's
build beautiful biotechnology, driven not only by the invisible hand but by the
dreams of human beings.

This kind of rhetoric is unique in the corporatized and "safe" world of
biology. Rather than explain it, we chose to demonstrate above. It is
polarizing yet truthful in our founding motivations, and may be an effective
tool in hiring and selling the vision of our corporation.

We know that other kinds of branding will be important in effectively
communicating our company's values, and we do not shy away from expecting this
to be an important part of the company, rather than an afterthought.

5. Conclusion

To review:
  1. Publication of biological experiments makes for natural network effects.
  2. There are many economies of scale in biology: centralization solves the
     problem of distributing solutions.
  3. We are focused on where we develop our proprietary technology
  4. We have unique, opinionated, and polarizing beliefs and a strong belief in
     the power of storytelling, rather than simply advertising, for branding

The basic fundamentals of biological experimentation make it primed for
monopoly, and so far has only been free of monopoly due to human communication
costs. This is changing right now, and we believe now will be the only time to
capture a lasting monopolistic position in this multi-billion dollar market.

                           Genetic Assemblies Theory

                General Automation will beat Specific Automation
                                       Or
                               CPUs over Circuits


Plasmidsaurus, a company doing nanopore sequencing, is the most laudable example
of a startup in the biotechnology space which has taken off. Their business
model worked because they replaced the existing Sanger sequencing infrastructure
of dropboxes with superior technology, and then got great at logistics.
Sequencing gets back to most customers within a couple hours of pickup using a
lab with many Opentrons liquid handlers and optimized workflows, and then the
data is delivered to customers in a convenient format.

This is a successful deep-tech company, bootstrapped, and profitable. But in our
mind, also limited, in that they've gotten very efficient at one specific niche
(sequencing services), without building the capacities to automate other
experiments - which is very difficult to integrate to build later. This limits
their ability to become a multi-billion dollar company, as the moat to
competition is relatively low - as shown by companies like Angstrom Innovation
undercutting Plasmidsaurus by 3x in their core business - and the fact that
adaptation slows when you need humans to run your lab.

Genetic Assemblies is fundamentally a services business. People pay us to do
something. What is our strategy to become a multi-billion dollar business?

The theory of Genetic Assemblies is that:
  1. Aggregation of services in one lab lowers the human labor cost of any
     given service
  2. A general lab system improves the velocity of developing or improving any
     specific service

For idea #1, we can take an extremely simple example, loading SYBR Green. SYBR
Green is used to quantify DNA. Quantification of DNA is needed in a bunch of
different systems: both for DNA sequencing and for cell-free protein expression.
While there are economies of scale when purchasing, the simple fact that you
only need humans to load the automated system once with a certain chemical
doubles the efficiency compared to having to load the system twice in two
different labs doing two different services. You can then aggregate *all inputs*
to biological experiments, and see how this dramatically lowers the relative
human-labor time per experiment.

As you add more services, this advantage compounds. As you increase the number
of services running out of a single automated system, you decrease the relative
human labor needed to run any one of those individual services. At a certain
point, running many customer experiments will essentially require zero human
labor, other than the marginal cost of adding more of a given reagent.

For idea #2, the simple idea is that if a lab system is developed for general
purpose use, it will naturally be optimized for research and development. For a
counter-example, Plasmidsaurus uses a bunch of Opentrons OT2 robots, which makes
for killer economics since they're low cost robots. But they are very difficult
to add more automation onto, which is fine: their economics work well with
techs+robots, and they just need to add more labs and better logistics.

For us, Opentrons OT2 are insufficient. We're starting with DNA cloning, where
there are incubation steps and centrifugation steps (the labor intensive nature
is why we have a market edge right now). Our process requires methods that can't
just run on a single robot, and so we must develop capability to handle that. As
a convenient consequence (and in part why we started where we did), our system
can handle autonomously loading, running, and unloading material without human
intervention. This allows us to run the lab as software, rather than as an
esoteric and idiosyncratic protocol to be run by humans. 

We're betting that this software-based rather than protocol-based development of
services means we can iterate at a much faster pace than companies which work in
a singular niche, akin to how CPUs took over the world compared to circuits.
Circuits may be more efficient at certain tasks, but CPUs could be controlled by
software rather than hardware, and allowed far more rapid iteration speed. In
the end, tasks being defined by software changed everything. We are building a
CPU, not a circuit, for lab work.
